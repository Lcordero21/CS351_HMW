This will be extremely short, but in order to run the code (and run your own target) you have to adjust lines 122 and 123.
Line 122 is a list of array lengths (if you would like to adjust those) and Line 123 is where you can adjust the target. For the most part, there 
should be nothing else that needs adjusting, just those two! Just keep an eye out for any error messages I implemented and what each function 
takes as an input (if you really decide to change things)
