    "## Problem Description: The Pancake Sorting Challenge\n",
    "\n",
    "You are implementing a sorting algorithm for a **robotic pancake flipper** at an automated breakfast restaurant. The robot can only perform one specific operation: flipping a stack of pancakes from the top down to any position.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Challenge\n",
    "\n",
    "Implement the **Pancake Sorting Algorithm** - a unique sorting method that can only sort by \"flipping\" portions of the array from the beginning.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Core Requirements:\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Flip Operation:**\n",
    "- You can only flip from index 0 to any index k\n",
    "- A flip reverses the order of elements in that range\n",
    "- Example: `flip([4, 3, 1, 2], 2)` → `[1, 3, 4, 2]` (flipped indices 0-2)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Algorithm Constraints:**\n",
    "1. **Only flipping allowed**: No swapping, inserting, or other operations\n",
    "2. **Flip from start only**: Must always flip from index 0 to some position k\n",
    "3. **Minimize flips**: Algorithm should be reasonably efficient\n",
    "4. **Track operations**: Must return both sorted array and flip sequence\n",
    "5. **Handle duplicates**: Should work correctly with repeated values\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Input Specification:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Input: List of comparable elements (usually numbers)\n",
    "pancakes = [4, 3, 1, 2, 5]  # Unsorted stack of pancakes (sizes)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Optional parameters for advanced implementation:\n",
    "options = {\n",
    "    'track_flips': bool,        # Return sequence of flip operations\n",
    "    'minimize_flips': bool,     # Try to use fewer flips\n",
    "    'validate_only_flips': bool # Ensure only valid flip operations used\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Output Specification:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "{\n",
    "    'sorted_array': list,       # The final sorted array\n",
    "    'flip_sequence': list,      # List of flip positions used\n",
    "    'total_flips': int,         # Number of flips performed\n",
    "    'is_sorted': bool,          # Verification that result is sorted\n",
    "    'operations_log': list      # Step-by-step array states (optional)\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Pancake Sorting Algorithm Logic\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key insight:** To move the largest element to its correct position:\n",
    "1. Find the largest unsorted element\n",
    "2. If it's not at the front, flip to bring it to the front\n",
    "3. Flip it to its correct position at the end\n",
    "4. Repeat for the remaining unsorted portion\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example walkthrough:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Initial: [4, 3, 1, 2]\n",
    "Step 1: Find max (4) at index 0, flip to end → [2, 1, 3, 4]\n",
    "Step 2: Find max (3) at index 2, flip to front → [3, 1, 2, 4]\n",
    "Step 3: Flip max to position → [2, 1, 3, 4]\n",
    "Step 4: Find max (2) at index 0, flip to position → [1, 2, 3, 4]\n",
    "Result: [1, 2, 3, 4] in 4 flips\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Success Criteria\n",
    "Your algorithm must:\n",
    "- ✅ Sort arrays using ONLY flip operations from index 0\n",
    "- ✅ Handle arrays with duplicate values correctly\n",
    "- ✅ Work efficiently for arrays up to 20+ elements\n",
    "- ✅ Return detailed operation tracking\n",
    "- ✅ Pass all provided test cases\n",
    "- ✅ Demonstrate understanding of the flip-only constraint"
